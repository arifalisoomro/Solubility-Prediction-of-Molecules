# Solubility Prediction of Molecules

This project aims to predict the solubility of molecules in water using a linear regression model. Solubility is an important property in various chemical and pharmaceutical applications.

## Project Overview

- **Data Loading**: Importing molecular descriptor data.
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and organizing data for modeling.
- **Model Building**: Creating a linear regression model.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance and visualizing results.

## Files

- `Solubility_of_molecule.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all the steps and code.
- `data/solubility_data.csv`: Dataset used for the project.
